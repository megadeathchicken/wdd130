            <h2>History</h2>
            <p id="history1">In 1972, nestled in the heart of the rugged Appalachian Mountains, Willdwater Journey, Co.
                was born. Founded by outdoors enthusiast and former river guide, Finnigan "Finn" Willd, the company
                began with a simple mission: to share the thrill of white-water rafting with people from all walks of
                life, while prioritizing safety, fun, and connection to nature. His passion for the region's waterways
                lives on through the company, ensuring future generations can experience the thrill and beauty of the
                Nantahala River.</p>
            <p id="history2">Finn, a Bryson City native, grew up along the banks of the Nantahala, spending his
                childhood exploring the winding currents and learning the secrets of the river. After years of guiding
                rafting tours for larger companies, he realized there was something missing: a sense of personal
                connection. Finn dreamed of a company where families could come together, share laughter, and bond over
                a shared adventure, all while cultivating a deep respect for the environment.</p>
            <img id="history-image" src="images/history.webp" alt="Willdwater Journey, Co.">
            <p id="history3">Thus, Willdwater Journey was founded—rooted in values of family, community, and wholesome
                outdoor fun. Over the years, Willdwater Journey has become known not only for its thrilling white-water
                expeditions but also for its welcoming, family-oriented approach. Each trip is designed to cater to
                adventurers of all ages and experience levels, ensuring that everyone—from toddlers to grandparents—can
                enjoy the beauty and power of the river together.</p>
            <p id="history4">With an emphasis on environmental responsibility, Willdwater Journey has led the way in
                sustainable tourism practices, ensuring the rivers remain pristine for generations to come. Today, the
                company continues to thrive under the guidance of Finn's children, who uphold their father's original
                vision. For them, the river is not just a business—it's a way of life.</p>
            <p id="history5">✨ Willdwater Journey, Co. is more than just a rafting company—it's an invitation to create
                lasting memories with the people who matter most. ✨</p>
